# text-adventure

An text-based adventure game as an example for a good friend.

It is explicitly programmed in a way that allows a "beginner" programmer to understand the code.
This means, that there are definitely many things that could be improved, esp. the nature of the Enemy and Player class (e.g. by inheritance with an "Entity" superclass), but also that it is not complete in any way.

# text-adventure

An unfinished, basic text-based adventure game as an example for a good friend.

It is explicitly programmed in a way that allows a beginner programmer to understand the code.
This means that there are definitely many things that could be improved, esp. the nature of the Enemy and Player class (e.g. by inheritance with an "Entity" superclass) and that some things are intentionally kept simple.

## Basic features

* Player can move inbetween locations
* Player can pick up items from locations
* Player could be randomly attacked if he moves certain shortcuts
